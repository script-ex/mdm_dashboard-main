There seemed to have been no sensitivity to, or consideration of the seven law-abiding citizens who were inconvenienced or stopped without any reason, other than race. The ACLU, citing incidents in Northern California, states that 'The California Highway Patrol (CHP) routinely violates the rights of African American and Latino drivers by targeting them on the basis of race.' This statement was made from the data resulting from a law suit filed against the CHP noting that in 1997 alone, the CHP stopped nearly 34,000 people but found less than 2% of them were actually carrying drugs. 'We believe the vast majority of these stops were based on race and we intend to prove it.'",
  "Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, San Diego and San Jose, California":"Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, San Diego and San Jose, California are three of the several major metropolitan areas that are beginning to attack racial profiling. In Houston, officers are required to enter information on the race, age and gender of all people they stop or arrest into their patrol-car computers. The reports will be placed in a database for review by the Police Chief, police managers and the department's Internal Affairs Division. Any confirmed incidents of racial profiling could result in a guilty officer's dismissal or even criminal charges. Several patrolmen's associations and civil-rights groups applauded the new policies.",
